# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
It is a feature-rich MERN Stack Admin Dashboard by integrating Material UI, Material UI Data Grid, Nivo Charts, Redux Toolkit, and Redux Toolkit Query for the frontend. On the backend, I employed Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB, while also demonstrating expertise in creating data models through Entity Relationship Diagrams and executing advanced aggregate queries in MongoDB.
